# to get the diffs for a specific tag
# tag = 20
# lines = IO.popen('git diff #{tag-1} #{tag} sandbox').readlines
# ...and then parse the lines....
# From this I need only the lines deleted and added and
# at what position (line-number)
# Do the deleted or added lines tend to get displayed first?
# What does github do?
# Answer deleted lines first 
#   (with a - in column 1, faintish red background)
#   no line number before column 1
# then added lines next
#   (with a + in column 1, faintish green background)
#   with line numbers before column 1
#
# Line background colouring is full-width on github.
# Think I prefer just the width of the line itself.
