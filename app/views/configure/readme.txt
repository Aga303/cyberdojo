This is partial work towards a new configure page.
New features will be

o) naming the dojo will be on the same page as configuring it.
   This means the home page will have one button without
   accompanying input text to configure it, and one input text
   with associated buttons for start/continue/dashboard/messages.
   
o) the view of a kata+language combination will show you
   all the files in that fileset, just like you get in the
   main page if you code from that fileset.
   
o) a starting fileset will consist of files from a single
   folder described by a single manifest.rb
   The reason for this change is that I want to work towards
   two features...
   
o) players can create a new named fileset from their current
   files when in the main page.
   
o) players can create a new named fileset from any traffic light.

o) the fileset could be named if you want to reuse it as a
   generally available starting fileset, or it could be unnamed
   if you just want to continue on from the current position.
   
o) a fileset created from the current files will need to be comprised
   of the current visible files and the hidden files (eg jars) of
   the starting fileset.
