Non-identification
==================
o) Players should be able to do a kata without identifying themselves.
   There is scope for allowing them to identify themself if they want to but
   it should not be compulsory. 

Main page
=========
o) I'd like the main page to show
   i) a kata-catalogue describing all the katas you can choose from
      Ultimately it would be nice if each kata had some kind of ranking
      to measure how difficult it was. One possibility is simply the mean
      time previous players took to do it.
   i) a link to a list of past katas
   i) a link to a list of katas currently in progress

Set up an existing kata
=======================
o) If you select a kata from the kata-catalogue you will then
   be asked for a short description of the session.
   Confirming the description makes that description appear in
   the list of katas currently in progress. This should be all
   a sensei needs to do to set up an existing kata. And the 
   description should act (on the surface) as the identifier for
   the kata.

Starting a kata
===============
o) In the list of katas currently in progress you
   click on the description and are taken to the 
   dojo door. At the dojo door you select your simply select 
   your animal avatar and you have started.

Stopping a kata
===============
o) You should be able to explicitly say you want to stop the kata,
   possibly indicating whether you have or haven't met the requirements.

Enhanced file-support
=====================
o) players should be able to
   i) add a new file
   i) drop an existing file
   i) rename an existing file
   i) move a file from visible <--> hidden

Creating a new kata
===================
o) Once the enhanced file-support above is in place we are nearly at
   the stage of being able to create a new kata simply by 
     i) naming it
     i) describing the requirements (optional!)
     i) specifying the language (eg python)
   The kata then starts with just kata.sh and run_tests_output and players
   add files as necessary and write kata.sh as they wish. For this to
   work the manifest needs to be per increment not per kata so it can 
   change from increment to increment.

   This is where I want to get to. It makes it very very fast for a group
   of developers to start working on a problem together.

   However, one thing makes this somewhat tricky - the unit-test support.
   The chosen unit test framework (not the language) determines which
   regexp patterns work on the run_tests_output to identify a 
   red/green/grey outcome. Therefore, when specifying the language
   you should also get the default unit-test-framework selected for that
   language. If you want to choose an alternative unit-test framework you
   should be able to but only once regexp support is provided for it.
