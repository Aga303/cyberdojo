The game of yahtzee is a simple dice game. In the full
game, in each round, each player rolls five six sided dice.
The player may choose to reroll some or all of the dice up 
to three times (including the original roll). The player then 
places the roll in a category, such as ones, twos, sixes, 
pair, two pairs etc. 

If the roll is compatible with the score, the player gets 
a score for this roll according to the rules. 
If the roll 
is not compatible, the player gets a score of zero for 
this roll.

roll in a given category.
