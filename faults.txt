In the diff-view, the editor and the output tabs have different line-number widths
and this causes a jump when switching between the two. 

When configuring, if you choose a name that has already been taken you get
a new browser tab. Needs to stay on the same browser tab. (Will be
taken of when the chosen name is "salted" so it is always ok.)

When starting/resuming/etc, if you choose a name that does not exist you get
a new browser tab. Need to stay on the same browser tab.

In Opera, the line number scrolling does not synchronize.

In Opera, the editor_line_numbers textarea is scrollable. It should not be.
Or rather, if it does scroll it should bind to the editor and scroll that.
