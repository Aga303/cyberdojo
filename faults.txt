Sometimes, after pressing run-tests, the contents of one file overwrite a
different file. Rather than fixing this I plan to rework the design so that
each file has its own textarea and selecting a file simply hides the current
textarea and shows the next textarea (like it already does when switching
between the output and editor). 

The line numbers are held in a textarea. This presumably means they are
sent to the server every time the form is submitted. That's wasteful.

In the diff-view, the editor and the output tabs have different line-number widths
and this causes a jump when switching between the two. 

If the editor tab is selected and you hit Alt-T to run the tests
then the "Running tests..." message does not appear on the output tab.

If the output tab is clicked on so the output textarea does not
have the focus then the Alt-T shortcut does not work.

When configuring, if you choose a name that has already been taken you get
a new browser tab. Needs to stay on the same browser tab. (Will be
taken of when the chosen name is "salted" so it is always ok.)

When starting/resuming/etc, if you choose a name that does not exist you get
a new browser tab. Need to stay on the same browser tab.

In Opera, the line number scrolling does not synchronize.

In Opera, the editor_line_numbers textarea is scrollable. It should not be.
Or rather, if it does scroll it should bind to the editor and scroll that.
