VISION AND PRINCIPLES
=====================

CyberDojo website
-----------------
Ultimately I would like a live CyberDojo website where developers can
go to do katas both individually and collectively. Clearly if players
are in different physical locations they cannot shuffle teams at each
iteration-bell. However, since the codebases are never on the laptops
but always held on the CyberDojo server it will still possible to shuffle 
codebases at each iteration-bell. 


Player-identification
---------------------
Players should be able to do a kata without identifying themselves.
However if players wish to identify themselves (in some way) it should
be possible to return to and continue previous katas.


Setting up a new kata
---------------------
After adding and renaming files from a blank state and doing many increments
you may have the files in a state that you want to become the starting fileset
for a new kata. It would be nice if there was a way to click a button and
the CyberDojo server automatically did that for you.


Metrics
-------
Ultimately it would be nice if each kata-name had some kind of ranking
to measure how difficult it was. One possibility is simply the mean
time previous players took to do it. This probably requires that each 
kata be explicitly marked as finished.


Enhanced file-support
---------------------
Allow filenames to have a full path including folders.
