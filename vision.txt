VISION AND PRINCIPLES
=====================

Deliberate Practice
-------------------
I believe that the role of deliberate practice has vast untapped potential 
in the field of software development. My particularly passion is doing deliberate 
software practice in a collaborative way. Hence CyberDojo.  

I would like a central CyberDojo where you do named practice sessions
inside named dojos and everything is visible to everyone. Open Kimono.
Software luminaries such as Ward Cunningham could be tempted to do their katas
which would be recorded for posterity.

I would like to see students using cyberdojo, and their tutors marking
their work not just based on a static snapshot of how it ends up but also
on the dynamic way it changed as it was worked on. And possibly during 
several explicit repetitions. 

I can also imagine job applicants being asked to perform some katas
in CyberDojo and the resulting "session video" being used to help the
applicants prove their ability. 
 

Player-identification
---------------------
Players should be able to do a kata without identifying themselves
However if players wish to identify themselves (eg my naming their dojo after
themselves) it should be possible to return to and continue previous katas. 
However, this idea is somewhat in tension with the idea of deliberate practice 
and in particular the idea of repetition. I think it might be useful to be able 
to mark a deliberate practice session as being over to encourage participants 
to repeat the session.


Server-image
------------
The server should have a full image that can be saved onto a memory stick
and provides a pre-prepared os to boot into. This would provide a very
quick start if you wanted to run a CyberDojo server but did not have all
the compilers installed on your computer.


Traffic-lights
--------------
Currently the CyberDojo server has to be programmed with regexp patterns
to parse the output of cyberdojo.sh as red/amber/green.
If the unit-test-framework is not specified in the manifest, or if it
is but there is no ruby parse-function for it then the server could
redirect to a different page which asks the players themselves to
be a human traffic-light and mark the output themselves. This would
be nice for making a very quick start in a new language. It could also be
used to gather data to test regexp patterns!


Setting up a new kata
---------------------
After adding and renaming files from a blank state and doing many increments
you may have the files in a state that you want to become the starting fileset
for a new kata. It would be nice if there was a way to click a button and
the CyberDojo server automatically did that for you.
