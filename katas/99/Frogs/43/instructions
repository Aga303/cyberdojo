Your task is to write a function to remove all occurences 
of the two characters \ (backslash) and \n (newline) when 
they occur consecutively in an array of chars.

Some examples:

Before  "abc\\ndef"
After   "abcdef"
The unsplice operation has removed one occurence of the 
backslash newline pair.

Before   "abc\d\nef"
After    "abc\d\nef"
The unspliced version is unchanged because the backslash 
and newline characters are not consecutive.

Before   "abc\n\def"
After    "abc\n\def"
The unspliced version is unchanged because the backslash 
and newline characters are in the wrong order.

Before  "abc\\nde\\nfg"
After   "abcdefg"
The unsplice operation has removed two occurences of the 
backslash newline pair.

Before   "abc\\\n\ndef"
After    "abc\\ndef"
The unspliced operation has removed one occurence of the 
backslash newline pair. Note that another occurence of the 
backslash newline pair remains. The unsplice operation is 
'one-pass only'.
